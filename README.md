# Distribution Fitting with Deep Neural Networks and Variational Inference

This project is focused on fitting complex data distributions (P(Y|X, D)) using a deep neural network. The network is designed to output a Gaussian mixture, and we employ the variational inference technique for training.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately model complex data distributions. By using a deep neural network that outputs a Gaussian mixture, we can capture the intricate patterns and relationships within the data. The variational inference technique allows us to train the network in a probabilistic manner, providing a robust and flexible model.

## Methodology

1. **Deep Neural Networks**: We use deep learning to capture the non-linear relationships within the data. The network is designed to output a Gaussian mixture, allowing us to model a wide range of data distributions.

2. **Gaussian Mixture Models**: The output of the network is a Gaussian mixture, which can model complex and multi-modal data distributions.

3. **Variational Inference**: We use variational inference for training, which allows us to optimize the network in a probabilistic manner. This provides a robust and flexible model that can adapt to various data distributions.
